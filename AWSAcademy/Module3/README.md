# Global Infrastructure Overview

## Section 1: AWS Global Infrastructure Overview

### AWS Global Infrastructure

AWS has 31 geographic regions around the world, with 99 availability zones and 216 edge locations. Each region is a separate geographic area. Each region has multiple, isolated locations known as availability zones. Each availability zone has redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities. Each availability zone is isolated, but the availability zones in a region are connected through low-latency links. Each region is completely independent. This means that availability zones in different regions are isolated from each other. This is important because it means that if one region goes down, another region will not be affected.

- **Region**: A region is a physical location in the world that consists of one or more availability zones. Each region is a separate geographic area. Each region has multiple, isolated locations known as availability zones. Each availability zone has redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities. Each availability zone is isolated, but the availability zones in a region are connected through low-latency links. Each region is completely independent. This means that availability zones in different regions are isolated from each other. This is important because it means that if one region goes down, another region will not be affected.

  - **Region Code**: A region code is a code that AWS uses to identify a region. For example, the region code for the US East (N. Virginia) region is us-east-1. The region code for the Asia Pacific (Mumbai) region is ap-south-1.
  - **Region Name**: A region name is a name that AWS uses to identify a region. For example, the region name for the US East (N. Virginia) region is US East (N. Virginia). The region name for the Asia Pacific (Mumbai) region is Asia Pacific (Mumbai).
  - **Region Endpoint**: A region endpoint is a URL that is used to access an AWS service in a region. For example, the region endpoint for the US East (N. Virginia) region is ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com. The region endpoint for the Asia Pacific (Mumbai) region is ec2.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com.

- **Availability Zone**: An availability zone is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS region. Availability zones enable you to operate production applications and databases that are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than would be possible from a single data center. The availability zones in a region are connected through low-latency links. Availability zones are physically separated by a meaningful distance, many kilometers, from any other availability zone, although all are within 100 km (60 miles) of each other.
  - **Availability Zone Code**: An availability zone code is a code that AWS uses to identify an availability zone. For example, the availability zone code for the US East (N. Virginia) region is us-east-1a. The availability zone code for the Asia Pacific (Mumbai) region is ap-south-1a.

  - **Availability Zone Name**: An availability zone name is a name that AWS uses to identify an availability zone. For example, the availability zone name for the US East (N. Virginia) region is US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1a. The availability zone name for the Asia Pacific (Mumbai) region is Asia Pacific (Mumbai) ap-south-1a.
  - **Availability Zone Endpoint**: An availability zone endpoint is a URL that is used to access an AWS service in an availability zone. For example, the availability zone endpoint for the US East (N. Virginia) region is ec2.us-east-1a.amazonaws.com. The availability zone endpoint for the Asia Pacific (Mumbai) region is ec2.ap-south-1a.amazonaws.com.

if there is a problem with one availability zone, the other availability zones in the region are not affected. This is important because it means that if one availability zone goes down, another availability zone will not be affected.

### Factors to Consider When Choosing a Region

- Governance, compliance, and legal requirements
- Proximity to customers (latency)
- Available services
- Pricing

### Data centers

- Designed to offer a secure, redundant, and reliable environment for servers, storage, and networking equipment
- Each data center is designed to run independently from other data centers
- Each data center has between 50,000 and 80,000 servers

### Points of Presence

- AWS has 187 points of presence (EDGE LOCATIONS OR BORDER POINTS) .
- Amazon CloudFront uses these points of presence to distribute content to end users with low latency.
- Border Cache is a service that uses these points of presence to cache content that is stored in an S3 bucket. Low access frequency.
